## Runnings LEGO and this repository in parallel

> When working in development you want to have LEGO running (both frontend and backend). This allows you to create an OAuth2 application from the settings menu in the webapp.

You need a total of **4 terminals**(or shells if you like).

### Terminal 1

Run LEGO by following the [README here](https://github.com/webkom/lego#readme)

### Terminal 2

Run LEGO-WEBAPP by following the [README here](https://github.com/webkom/lego-webapp#readme)

### Terminal 3

Run the admissions backend by doing the following:

Running the backend requires Python 3.9 and a `postgresql` database. The frontend requires `Node`. We recommend using
a virtual environment. Create a `venv` in root using

```sh
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ make dev_settings
```

The `docker-compose.yml` file provides a `postgresql` database. This uses a different port than LEGO, so you can run it in parallel.

```sh
$ docker-compose up -d
```

Install requirements either with the default

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```

or by first installing [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) and running

```sh
$ pip install pip-tools
$ pip-sync requirements/development.txt
```

The `.env` file with secret keys is not included, but an `example.env` file has been provided in `./admissions/settings`, so that you can simply rename the file and fill in the values.

The secrets can be found at **localhost:3000** in the user settings menu after creating an OAuth2 app there. In the form enter `http://127.0.0.1:5000/complete/lego/` as the redirect url.

```sh
# Create a copy of the example env file (run from the root of the project)
$ cp admissions/settings/example.env admissions/settings/.env

# Edit the file and change the KEY and SECRET
AUTH_LEGO_KEY="Client ID from OAuth2"
AUTH_LEGO_SECRET="Client Secret from OAuth2"
AUTH_LEGO_API_URL="http://localhost:8000/"
```

Now you are ready to migrate the database, create some fixtures, and run the server.

```sh
# Migrate the database migrations
$ python manage.py migrate

# Create a custom admission for development
$ python manage.py create_admission

# Run the Django server
$ python manage.py runserver
```

> If coding over long periods of time, simply flush the db with `python manage.py flush` and run the server again.

### Terminal 4

In the last terminal you are ready to start the frontend. Simply install the requirement and run the dev-server.

```sh
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Start the dev-server
$ yarn dev
```

> Now you are ready, go to 127.0.0.1:5000

## Requirements

We use the package [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to organize our requirements.

### Adding a new requirement

Add the new package to either `base.in`, `development.in` or
`production.in` depending on best fit. Then generate a new requirements
file by running

We use [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to make the requirement files easy to understand and maintain.
Run the following custom command to update `development.txt` and `production.txt`.

```sh
$ python manage.py compile_requirements
```

Or the manual way

```sh
$ pip-compile requirements/development.in > requirements/development.txt
```

To sync your virtual environment with the requirements file, do

```sh
$ pip-sync requirements/development.txt
```

This will install missing packages, install the correct version and
remove excess packages.

## Creating admissions

Currently when running

```sh
# Create a custom admission for development
$ python manage.py create_admission
```

you create an admisison not connected to any group. To connect it to a group, this must be done in the shell. Note that when
creating gruops, you must import the Group model manually, as otherwise it will use the Django Group model instead of our own.

## Run tests

Run django tests using tox. Note that we point at the admissions database running at :5433 if we are running lego and admissions
in parallel

```bash
$ DATABASE_PORT=5433 tox -e tests
```

## Code Style

This codebase uses the PEP 8 code style. We enforce this with isort, black & flake8.
In addition to the standards outlined in PEP 8, we have a few guidelines
(see `setup.cfg` for more info):

Format the code with black & isort

```bash
$ make fixme
```

To check if it is formatted properly, run:

```bash
$ DATABASE_PORT=5433 tox -e isort -e flake8 -e black
```
